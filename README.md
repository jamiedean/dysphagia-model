# Severe acute dysphagia normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model

Penalised logistic regression model of severe acute dysphagia resulting from head and neck radiotherapy.

To run the model use the PredictDysphagiaNtcp.py Python script. The Model folder and inputData.csv file should be in the working directory. Values for the model covariates should be entered into the inputData.csv file.

The following dependencies should be installed:

- Python version 2 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- The simplist way to install all of the necessary packages is to use a Python distribution, such as Enthought Canopy (https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/). Other distributions are available (https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDistributions).  Most distributions have free versions and full versions are often free for academics. 

The manuscript detailing the model training and validation is currently under review.

This model is strictly for research purposes only. It should not be used for any clinical purposes.

If you encounter any problems trying to use the model or wish to discuss any aspects of it please feel free to contact me at jamie.adam.dean@gmail.com.
